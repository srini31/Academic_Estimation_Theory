# Academic_Estimation_Theory: System-Identification-Model-detection

In this project, data about Tree Ring index is chosen and a model is identified that fits the data closely from: 
– Auto regressive process (AR)
- Moving Average (MA)
– Auto regressive Moving Average process (ARMA)

Once that is identified we need to estimate the parameters (a1, a2,…ana, b1, b2, …bnb). We use Maximum Likelihood estimation for this. Finally need to verify if the estimated parameters fit the confidence interval. If the parameters don’t fit the confidence interval, the order of the process should be changed (increased or decreased) and the parameters are re-estimated.
